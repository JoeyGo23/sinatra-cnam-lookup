An example Sinatra app that uses [Open CNAM](opencnam.com) to validate a name and phone number pair. This could be used for extra security on user sign-up, making sure users are who they say they are. To stop a potential user from using a number that is not theirs, one could use a text message verification code (perhaps using [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com/)). I plan to add this functionality to the app next.
